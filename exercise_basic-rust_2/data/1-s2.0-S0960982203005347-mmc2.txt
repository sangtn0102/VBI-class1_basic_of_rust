                    Mathematica-Compatible Notebook

This notebook can be used with any Mathematica-compatible
application, such as Mathematica, MathReader or Publicon. The data
for the notebook starts with the line containing stars above.

To get the notebook into a Mathematica-compatible application, do
one of the following:

* Save the data starting with the line of stars above into a file
  with a name ending in .nb, then open the file inside the
  application;

* Copy the data starting with the line of stars above to the
  clipboard, then use the Paste menu command inside the application.

sent directly in email or through ftp in text mode.  Newlines can be
CR, LF or CRLF (Unix, Macintosh or MS-DOS style).

NOTE: If you modify the data for this notebook not in a Mathematica-
compatible application, you must delete the line below containing
the word CacheID, otherwise Mathematica-compatible applications may
try to use invalid cache data.
